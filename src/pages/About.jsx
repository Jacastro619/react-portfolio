          I am a motivated and determined 26-year-old, eager to learn. I have
          developed a strong affinity for web development and am committed to
          learning as much as I can to build my skill set in tech. I have
          successfully obtained my Cloud Solution Architect Associate
          Certification from AWS (Amazon Web Services). I just recently obtained
          my Full Stack Engineering certification through UC Berkeley and
          learned highly sought-after industry skills.

          technology. I am a quick and efficient learner, always eager to take
          on new challenges and put my new skills to the test. My ultimate goal
          is to channel my expertise and creativity to achieve a fulfilling
          career in tech. I am eager to see where this next chapter of my life
          will take me.
